# Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to gather information useful to someone who is new to the HPC systems available at Wright State. 
In order to support a rapidly changing computational environment we have adopted the use of containers.  In this repository you 
will find guides that introduce our chosen container solution [Singularity](https://singularity.lbl.gov/) and our chosen job 
scheduler [Slurm Workload Manager](https://slurm.schedmd.com/).

## How to use this guide
To get the most of these materials you need to have a basic understanding of linux and knowledge of the computational problem 
you are trying to solve.
